## About

Aqua IDE is a lightweight and versatile Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed using the Electron framework. It provides a user-friendly interface and essential features to facilitate your coding experience. Please note that Aqua IDE is currently in beta version, which means it may still have some rough edges and limitations. We appreciate your understanding and welcome your feedback as we continue to improve and enhance the IDE.

## Features

- Project View: Aqua IDE offers a convenient project view with material icons, allowing you to navigate and manage your files and folders effortlessly. You can organize your project structure and easily access your source code files.

- File and Folder Management: With Aqua IDE, you can perform various file and folder operations such as updating, creating, editing, and deleting. This functionality enables you to efficiently manage your project assets.

- Light Mode and Dark Mode: Aqua IDE provides both light and dark modes, allowing you to choose the preferred theme that suits your coding environment and reduces eye strain.

- File Keyword Searching: Aqua IDE includes a powerful file keyword searching feature, enabling you to quickly search for specific words or phrases within your project files.

- Quick Font Size Adjustment: Aqua IDE allows you to conveniently adjust the font size by holding the `Ctrl` key and scrolling the mouse wheel. This feature provides a seamless way to optimize the readability of your code.

## Compatibility

Aqua IDE is designed to be a lightweight IDE suitable for small to medium-sized projects. While it provides essential features for general coding tasks, it may not be suitable for large-scale projects involving complex frameworks such as Laravel, React, etc. We recommend using specialized IDEs or code editors for such projects to ensure optimal performance and a comprehensive set of features tailored to their specific requirements.
